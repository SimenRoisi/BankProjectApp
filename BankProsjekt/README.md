Bankproject

This application was made as part of a two-part group project in the course DAT250 at UiS. 
The purpose of the project was to make a website with multiple functions and input fields, and then protecting it from OWASP Top 10 threats.

The second part of the project was to hack an other fellow student groups website by trying to extract critical data, and edit/take down the website if possible. 

The first part of the project is all that is included in this repository as the second part was not really python scripts. It was done by using different tools such as Kali Linux, Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP, as well as some javascript injections and SQL injection attempts.
